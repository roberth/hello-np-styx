# List first the packages that you edit locally and want compiled "all the time", by cabal:
local-packages:
  my-main-package: # package name
    location: .    # location on your disk

# If you want you can add other haskell nix packages to depend on.
# Normally this is not necessary, because nix will track the dependencies on its own.
# Thus this section is mostly useful for throw-away projects which do not have a cabal file.
nix-deps:
    - criterion
    - gasp
    - lens
    - statistics

# In case you depend on other non-haskell tools or libs.
non-haskell-deps:
    - z3
